#StorageJS
=========

This JavaScript project implements web storage (local or session), http request management, and client-side cache in a module called storageJS. It's not a catchy name, but, for me, it gets the point across.

##About
=========

After working with various single-page web applications over the last several years, I began to get frustrated that many third-party JavaScript libraries implemented web storage, http request management, and client-side cache in simple and elegant ways. I prefer simplification over complication. I don't need a library or framework that can do everything for everybody. I just wanted something that did what I wanted in a straightforward way. This is the genesis of StorageJS. 

The primary goal behind the project was to ensure modularity. This code is something I intend to use later, so, I wanted to be sure it can easily "plug" into an existing framework like Durandal or Angular. There may be some boilerplate code needed to wrap everything up, to be sure, but the core logic should never need to be modified.

I admit, it's no grand idea. Many other developers have already thought of and implemented it themselves - some of them quite suceessfully. However, this is my implementation, and, for better or worse, it's something I can say that I did and I can be proud of.
